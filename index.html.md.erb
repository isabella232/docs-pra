## <a id='exe_summary'></a>Executive Summary

VMware Tanzu Architecture for DellEMC VxRail (TA4V) is an integrated environment built on [hyperconverged](https://www.dellemc.com/en-us/converged-infrastructure/hyper-converged-infrastructure.htm) hardware/software infrastructure. It offers high performance potential, convenience, and addresses the challenges of creating, testing, and updating applications in a consolidated production environment. This represents a validated set of models anyone can adopt to get proven operation and benefits from the combined components. The models are organized as a maturity path: Minimal->Single Cluster->Multiple Cluster.

## <a id='benefits'></a>Key Benefits

TA4V enables you to quickly and reliably create an integrated application deployment platform and provides a variety of platform sizes to meet your needs. It is a validated set of models that use the scalable, hyper-converged DellEMC VxRail Appliance and VMware vSphere with VMware vSAN and NSX-T Data Center products. With TA4V, you can deploy a production-ready app containers environment quickly and reliably compared to a do-it-yourself approach.

The application container deployments are designed to meet application operational needs. Professional Services engagements from DellEMC and VMware can help with installing and testing TA4V in your IT environment. IT professionals tasked with planning compute, network, and storage capacity can work with DellEMC Professional Services to determine the sizing requirements for these resources.

TA4V enables developers to quickly publish, run, and scale legacy software, packaged software, and cloud-native applications. The TA4V platform is based on an integrated infrastructure that enables IT operators to easily manage and scale the development environment with tools such as VxRail Manager and Tanzu Operations Manager.

With TA4V, you benefit from:

* Reference architectures for a variety of highly available Tanzu application platforms
* Private cloud and infrastructure services with simplified deployment
* Highly available platform on which to develop and quickly deploy applications, reducing the time for application delivery
* Modern developer platforms that boost developer productivity by combining application services, service discovery, container management, and orchestration within an ecosystem of developer tool plug-ins
* Consistent cloud solution, providing increased reliability, portability, and agility
* Lifecycle management from the lowest level hardware system firmware to the highest level of app container deployment system of choice

## <a id='bill_of_materials'></a>Versions and Bill of Materials

### Validated Versions And Interoperability For This Release

This recommended architecture includes VMware vSphere and NSX-T Data Center, a software-defined network virtualization that runs on VMware ESXi hosts and combines routing, firewalling, NAT/SNAT, and load balancing. It also includes an application container layer from several choices available in the VMware Tanzu portfolio.

#### Supported Software Components For Interoperability

| Software Component|    Version |
| ------------- | -------------|
|VxRail HCI System Software|4.7.4--|
|VMware vSphere ESXi|7.0 GA build --------|
|VMware vCenter (VCSA)|7.0 GA build -------|
|VMware vSAN|7.0 GA build ------|
|VMware NSX-T Data Center|3.0 and newer|
|Tanzu Ops Manager|2.9.latest|
|Tanzu Application Service for VMs|2.9.latest|
|Tanzu Kubernetes Grid-integrated|1.7.latest|
|VMware NSX-T Container Plug-in for TAS4VMs|?.?.latest|
|VMware Harbor Registry|1.?.latest|
|Dell EMC ECS|3.3.X|

To use all the features listed here, NSX-T Data Center **requires at least Advanced licensing** from VMware when used with TAS for VMs. The equivalent of that licensing is included with TKG-i.

The following Bill of Materials was used to validate this interoperability matrix. These systems were selected as broadly representative of the common customer installations and do not limit or represent an exhaustive list of possibilities.
