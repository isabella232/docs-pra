## <a id='summary'></a>Upgrade Validation

Every edition of this publication is built on the one before it 
and each new edition is validated as an upgrade from the prior version. 
The BOM from the previous edition is loaded on a standard size 
hardware platform and verified working, then an upgrade procedure 
is run that parallels how customers would accomplish an upgrade. 
Notes on issues and outages are made and supplied back to R&D 
for each of the products in use. 
If any failures or outages are found that compromise the system, 
the process halts and feedback is provided. 
We do not publish a new TA4V edition (what you are reading now) 
unless a successful upgrade has been performed.

This process is run on both a TAS for VMs installation and a TKGI installation separately. 
A load generator is used to verify proper PaaS operation before, during and after upgrade. 
A suite of standard benchmark and throughput tests are performed as well.

Here are the Bills of Material of the previous and current edition that was used for upgrade testing.
