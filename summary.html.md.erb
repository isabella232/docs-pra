## <a id='summary'></a>Summary

VMware Tanzu Architecture for Dell EMC VxRail is a carefuly considered, full inclusive and regularly validated approach to using appropriate hardware and software elemnts to produce a highly scalable PaaS installation for today and future growth. The matruity path to follow starts with a minimally viable, low cost platform that features all the capability need for small and remote installations and concludes with an Enterprise-grade, full scale and expandable system that can be grown and upgraded over time without re-architecture. These models can be used and reused over and over around the business as needs arise. You can use these with confidence, as each edition has been fully tested on real world, full scale hardware exactly as described, to operate as described. Every validation cycle includes testing the upgrade path from

## <a id='pas_and_pks'></a>TAS for VMs and TKG-i Installation

A fully meshed TKG-i and TAS for VMs installation based on best practices and reference design considerations will look as follows:

[View a larger version of this diagram](./images/TA4V_TAS_TKGi_vSphere_NSX-T_MVP3.png).

Common elements are the NSX T0 router and the associated T1 routers. This approach allows for any possible cross traffic between TKG-i and TAS for VMs apps to stay within the bounds of the T0 router and not exit the NSX overlay. This also provides a convenient, singular access point to the whole installation, making deployments of multiple, identical installations easier to automate.

## <a id='further_considerations'></a>Further Considerations

The Host Groups feature introduced in TAS for VMs v2.XX superceeds the recommendation to use Resource Pools in vSphere Clusters as AZ constructs to stack different installations of PaaS. As server capacity continues to increase, the efficiency of deploying independent clusters of a server just for one install of one product is low. As customers are commonly deploying servers approaching 1T of RAM, stacking many Pivotal Platform installations in these clusters improves overall resource utilization.

You may be tempted to split the TAS for VMs and TKG-i installations into separate network parent/child configurations, behind separate T0 routers. Before doing this, review [VMware's best practices](https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/vmware-validated-design-pubs.html) for T0 to T0 routing efficiencies and weaknesses to ensure that approach meets your needs.
